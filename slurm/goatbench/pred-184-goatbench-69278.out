00:00:28 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the object exactly described as the 'white pillow near the clothes and iron board.'?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.

The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

00:01:37 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the object exactly described as the 'refrigerator in the kitchen. it is located next to the kitchen cabinet and the worktop.'?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.

The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

00:03:17 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the object exactly described as the 'refrigerator in the kitchen. it is located next to the kitchen cabinet and the worktop.'?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.

Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

00:05:44 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Can you find the microwave?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.

Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

00:07:17 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the exact object captured at the center of the following image? You need to pay attention to the environment and find the exact object.[iVBORw0KGg...]
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.

Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

00:08:49 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the exact object captured at the center of the following image? You need to pay attention to the environment and find the exact object.[iVBORw0KGg...]
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.
Snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: window[iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

00:11:11 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Can you find the mirror?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.

00:14:49 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the exact object captured at the center of the following image? You need to pay attention to the environment and find the exact object.[iVBORw0KGg...]
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.
Snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: trash bin[iVBORw0KGg...]

The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

00:17:06 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Can you find the book?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.

Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

00:18:27 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Can you find the refrigerator?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.
Snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: lamp[iVBORw0KGg...]Object 1: end table[iVBORw0KGg...]

The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

00:20:34 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Can you find the mirror?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.

Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 5 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.

00:22:57 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the object exactly described as the 'microwave on the kitchen shelf, which is located to the left of the kettle and below the coffee machine. the microwave is made of stainless steel.'?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.

00:24:37 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the exact object captured at the center of the following image? You need to pay attention to the environment and find the exact object.[iVBORw0KGg...]
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.
No Snapshot is available

Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 5 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 6 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

00:26:32 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the exact object captured at the center of the following image? You need to pay attention to the environment and find the exact object.[iVBORw0KGg...]
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.

00:27:27 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the object exactly described as the 'plant in the room with a window. the plant is located near the curtain on one side, and on the other side, there is a sofa chair. additionally, there is a fireplace nearby.'?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.

Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.

00:30:13 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the exact object captured at the center of the following image? You need to pay attention to the environment and find the exact object.[iVBORw0KGg...]
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.

Frontier 6 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 7 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

00:32:37 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the exact object captured at the center of the following image? You need to pay attention to the environment and find the exact object.[iVBORw0KGg...]
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.

Frontier 6 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 7 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

00:34:52 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Can you find the plant?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.

Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

00:36:08 - Input prompt:
00:36:08 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the object exactly described as the 'refrigerator located to the left of the cabinet.'?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.
Snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: cabinet[iVBORw0KGg...]
Snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: cabinet[iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

00:37:57 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the object exactly described as the 'rug that is located near the sofa, chair, table, painting, terrace, plant, and pillow. it is a wool rug in a neutral color.'?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.

00:39:47 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the object exactly described as the 'rug that is located near the sofa, chair, table, painting, terrace, plant, and pillow. it is a wool rug in a neutral color.'?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.

00:41:19 - Input prompt:
00:41:19 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the object exactly described as the 'cactus located on a pot, which is on a shelving.'?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.

Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

00:43:31 - Input prompt:
00:43:31 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Can you find the rug?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.
Snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: end table[iVBORw0KGg...]
Snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: end table[iVBORw0KGg...]
Snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: couch[iVBORw0KGg...]Object 1: coffee table[iVBORw0KGg...]

Snapshot 6 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: sofa chair[iVBORw0KGg...]Object 1: sofa chair[iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 5 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 6 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 7 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

00:45:19 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the exact object captured at the center of the following image? You need to pay attention to the environment and find the exact object.[iVBORw0KGg...]
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.

Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

00:48:22 - Input prompt:
00:48:22 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the exact object captured at the center of the following image? You need to pay attention to the environment and find the exact object.[iVBORw0KGg...]
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.
Snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: potted plant[iVBORw0KGg...]
Snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: potted plant[iVBORw0KGg...]
Snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: potted plant[iVBORw0KGg...]
Snapshot 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: potted plant[iVBORw0KGg...]
Snapshot 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: potted plant[iVBORw0KGg...]
Snapshot 5 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: potted plant[iVBORw0KGg...]
Snapshot 6 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: potted plant[iVBORw0KGg...]
Snapshot 7 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: potted plant[iVBORw0KGg...]
Snapshot 8 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: potted plant[iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 5 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 6 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

00:49:42 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the object exactly described as the 'rug that is located near the sofa, chair, table, painting, terrace, plant, and pillow. it is a wool rug in a neutral color.'?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.

Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the object exactly described as the 'the beveled mirror that is located to the right of the sink and below the cabinet.'?

00:52:49 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the object exactly described as the 'the beveled mirror that is located to the right of the sink and below the cabinet.'?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.

For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.

00:53:45 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the object exactly described as the 'the beveled mirror that is located to the right of the sink and below the cabinet.'?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.
Snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: sink[iVBORw0KGg...]Object 1: cabinet[iVBORw0KGg...]
Snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: mirror[iVBORw0KGg...]
Snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: sink[iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

00:55:36 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the exact object captured at the center of the following image? You need to pay attention to the environment and find the exact object.[iVBORw0KGg...]
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.

Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the object exactly described as the 'wooden nightstand with a white lamp on it. the nightstand is located to the right of the bed and below the pillow.'?

00:59:39 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the object exactly described as the 'wooden nightstand with a white lamp on it. the nightstand is located to the right of the bed and below the pillow.'?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.

01:02:27 - Input prompt:
01:02:27 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the object exactly described as the 'wooden nightstand with a white lamp on it. the nightstand is located to the right of the bed and below the pillow.'?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.
Snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: bed[iVBORw0KGg...]Object 1: pillow[iVBORw0KGg...]
Snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: bed[iVBORw0KGg...]Object 1: nightstand[iVBORw0KGg...]Object 2: lamp[iVBORw0KGg...]Object 3: pillow[iVBORw0KGg...]Object 4: pillow[iVBORw0KGg...]

Snapshot 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: lamp[iVBORw0KGg...]
Snapshot 5 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: lamp[iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 5 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 6 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 7 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

01:04:25 - Input prompt:
01:04:25 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the exact object captured at the center of the following image? You need to pay attention to the environment and find the exact object.[iVBORw0KGg...]
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.
Snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: cabinet[iVBORw0KGg...]
Snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: refrigerator[iVBORw0KGg...]Object 1: microwave[iVBORw0KGg...]Object 2: oven[iVBORw0KGg...]Object 3: coffee maker[iVBORw0KGg...]Object 4: cabinet[iVBORw0KGg...]

Snapshot 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: cabinet[iVBORw0KGg...]
Snapshot 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: cabinet[iVBORw0KGg...]
Snapshot 5 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: microwave[iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 5 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 6 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 7 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

01:06:47 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the object exactly described as the 'cactus plant. it is located near the mirror, to the right of the table, and slightly above the rug.'?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.

01:09:03 - Input prompt:
01:09:03 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the exact object captured at the center of the following image? You need to pay attention to the environment and find the exact object.[iVBORw0KGg...]
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.
Snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: mirror[iVBORw0KGg...]
Snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: mirror[iVBORw0KGg...]
Snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: mirror[iVBORw0KGg...]
Snapshot 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: mirror[iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 5 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 6 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

01:11:17 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the exact object captured at the center of the following image? You need to pay attention to the environment and find the exact object.[iVBORw0KGg...]
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.

Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

01:13:45 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the object exactly described as the 'the painting by the chair.'?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.
Snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: chair[iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.

01:16:52 - Input prompt:
01:16:52 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the object exactly described as the 'picture located in a hallway with two paintings on the wall. the picture is spatially relative to the other objects in the scene.'?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.
Snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: picture[iVBORw0KGg...]
Snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: picture[iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

01:16:58 - HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
01:16:58 - Response: [frontier 3]
Reason: [The description mentions a hallway with two paintings, which isn't clearly visible in the current snapshots. Exploring Frontier 3 might lead to a hallway that fits the description.]
01:16:58 - Prediction: frontier, 3
01:16:58 - Next choice: Frontier at [79 62]

01:18:41 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the object exactly described as the 'refrigerator in the kitchen cabinet.'?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.
Snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: cabinet[iVBORw0KGg...]
Snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: cabinet[iVBORw0KGg...]

Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 5 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

01:20:11 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the object exactly described as the 'picture located in a hallway with two paintings on the wall. the picture is spatially relative to the other objects in the scene.'?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.

Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

01:22:19 - Input prompt:
01:22:19 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Can you find the piano?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.
Snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: couch[iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

01:23:16 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Can you find the piano?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.
Snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: bench[iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.
