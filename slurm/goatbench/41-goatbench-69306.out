00:00:33 - Input prompt:
00:00:33 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Can you find the piano?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.
Snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: lamp[iVBORw0KGg...]Object 1: couch[iVBORw0KGg...]Object 2: end table[iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

Reason: [I chose Frontier 0 to explore further, as the current snapshots do not show a piano, and exploring the unexplored area might lead to finding it.]

00:01:56 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Can you find the piano?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.

The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore:

Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

00:04:16 - Input prompt:
00:04:16 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Can you find the rug?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.

Snapshot 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: couch[iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

00:05:27 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the object exactly described as the 'dresser located below the mirror in the room.'?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.

00:07:54 - Input prompt:
00:07:54 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Can you find the mirror?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.
Snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: nightstand[iVBORw0KGg...]
Snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: end table[iVBORw0KGg...]
Snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: nightstand[iVBORw0KGg...]
Snapshot 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: cabinet[iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

00:08:03 - HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
00:08:03 - Response: [snapshot 0, object 0]
Reason: [The mirror is visible in Snapshot 0 above the nightstand.]

00:08:49 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the object exactly described as the 'dresser located below the mirror in the room.'?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.
Snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: cabinet[iVBORw0KGg...]

Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

00:10:26 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the exact object captured at the center of the following image? You need to pay attention to the environment and find the exact object.[iVBORw0KGg...]
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.

00:14:23 - Input prompt:
00:14:23 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Can you find the mirror?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.
Snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: nightstand[iVBORw0KGg...]
Snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: nightstand[iVBORw0KGg...]
Snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: nightstand[iVBORw0KGg...]
Snapshot 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: mirror[iVBORw0KGg...]Object 1: cabinet[iVBORw0KGg...]
Snapshot 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: end table[iVBORw0KGg...]
Snapshot 5 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: nightstand[iVBORw0KGg...]
Snapshot 6 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: wardrobe[iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

00:14:50 - Input prompt:
00:14:50 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the object exactly described as the 'dresser located below the mirror in the room.'?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.
Snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: nightstand[iVBORw0KGg...]
Snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: nightstand[iVBORw0KGg...]

Snapshot 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: nightstand[iVBORw0KGg...]
Snapshot 5 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: wardrobe[iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore:

Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

00:17:14 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the exact object captured at the center of the following image? You need to pay attention to the environment and find the exact object.[iVBORw0KGg...]
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.

Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

00:20:20 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the exact object captured at the center of the following image? You need to pay attention to the environment and find the exact object.[iVBORw0KGg...]
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.
Snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: mirror[iVBORw0KGg...]
Snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: mirror[iVBORw0KGg...]

Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

00:23:55 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the exact object captured at the center of the following image? You need to pay attention to the environment and find the exact object.[iVBORw0KGg...]
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.
Snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: mirror[iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

00:27:16 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the exact object captured at the center of the following image? You need to pay attention to the environment and find the exact object.[iVBORw0KGg...]
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.

The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.

00:30:51 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the exact object captured at the center of the following image? You need to pay attention to the environment and find the exact object.[iVBORw0KGg...]
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.
Snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: mirror[iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

00:34:05 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the exact object captured at the center of the following image? You need to pay attention to the environment and find the exact object.[iVBORw0KGg...]
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.

Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

00:37:30 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the exact object captured at the center of the following image? You need to pay attention to the environment and find the exact object.[iVBORw0KGg...]
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.
Snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]Object 0: mirror[iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

00:40:21 - Input prompt:
00:40:21 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Can you find the carpet?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.

The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

00:41:02 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Can you find the carpet?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.

The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

00:43:05 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the object exactly described as the 'refrigerator located in the kitchen cabinet.'?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.

00:44:33 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Could you find the object exactly described as the 'mirror in the bathroom. start by locating the bathroom counter and the sink. the mirror should be located near the sink. look for a reflective surface attached to the wall. it is a bathroom mirror.'?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.

Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.

00:46:38 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Can you find the hanging clothes?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.

Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i, Object j' or 'Frontier i', where i, j are the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the fridge in the first snapshot, please return 'Snapshot 0, Object 2', where 2 is the index of the fridge in that snapshot.
You can explain the reason for your choice, but put it in a new line after the choice.

00:48:37 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Can you find the hanging clothes?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.

00:50:47 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Can you find the hanging clothes?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.

00:53:24 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Can you find the hanging clothes?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.

00:56:22 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Can you find the hanging clothes?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.

00:59:12 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene that is able to observe the surroundings and explore the environment. You are tasked with indoor navigation, and you are required to choose either a Snapshot or a Frontier image to explore and find the target object required in the question.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. It contains a full image of the cluster of objects, and separate image crops of each object. Choosing a snapshot means that the object asked in the question is within the cluster of objects that the snapshot represents, and you will choose that object as the final answer of the question. Therefore, if you choose a snapshot, you should also choose the object in the snapshot that you think is the answer to the question.
Frontier: An unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.
Question: Can you find the hanging clothes?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose. Following each snapshot image are the class name and image crop of each object contained in the snapshot.
Please note that the class name may not be accurate due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make the decision.
