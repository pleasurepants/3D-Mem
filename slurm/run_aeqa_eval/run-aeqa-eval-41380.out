00:00:28 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What is hanging from the oven handle?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
Snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]chair, folded chair
Snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]folded chair
Snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]pillow
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:02:02 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What is hanging from the oven handle?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

00:03:40 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What material are the stools in the kitchen made out of?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.

00:07:06 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where is the teddy bear?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
Snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]coffee table, couch, pillow
Snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]coffee table, pillow, sofa chair
Snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]cabinet
Snapshot 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]couch, pillow
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:08:37 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where is the teddy bear?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
Snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]cabinet, pillow, sofa chair
Snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]coffee table, couch, pillow
Snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]pillow
Snapshot 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]coffee table
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:13:22 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: I want to host a dinner party on a summer evening, where should I set the table?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
Snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]window
Snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]bench
Snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]couch, fireplace
Snapshot 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]coffee table
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore:

Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 5 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 6 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 7 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: I want to host a dinner party on a summer evening, where should I set the table?

00:17:20 - Input prompt:
00:17:20 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: where can I keep a new knife I got?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
Snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]cabinet
Snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]shelf
Snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]shelf
Snapshot 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]counter
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:20:30 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What color is the front door?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No Snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 5 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 6 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:22:04 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What color are the pillows in the kitchen?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:23:47 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What color is the countertop on the porch?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:27:02 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What color is the countertop on the porch?

Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.

00:31:01 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What color is the countertop on the porch?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
Snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]bench
Snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]stool
Snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]bench
Snapshot 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]dining table, folded chair

Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 5 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 6 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 7 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:33:07 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What color is the countertop on the porch?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
Snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]bench
Snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]bench
Snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]bench
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 5 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 6 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What color is the countertop on the porch?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What color is the countertop on the porch?
Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Frontier 6 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.
