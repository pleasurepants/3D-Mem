00:02:25 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What is hanging from the oven handle?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]chair
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:03:58 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What is hanging from the oven handle?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:06:01 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What material are the stools in the kitchen made out of?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]coffee table, pillow
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]coffee table, couch, pillow
snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]couch, pillow, sofa chair
snapshot 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]cabinet
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:14:12 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What type of numbers are on the clock?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]clock
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]clock
snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]clock
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:16:02 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: I want to host a dinner party on a summer evening, where should I set the table?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:20:23 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: I want to host a dinner party on a summer evening, where should I set the table?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]coffee table, couch

Frontier 7 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i

The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:23:00 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: I want to host a dinner party on a summer evening, where should I set the table?

00:25:00 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: where can I keep a new knife I got?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]cabinet, sink
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]shelf
snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]shelf
snapshot 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]counter
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1

00:30:14 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What color is the countertop on the porch?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What color is the countertop on the porch?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.

The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

00:36:18 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What color is the countertop on the porch?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:39:04 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What color is the countertop on the porch?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.

snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What color is the countertop on the porch?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 5 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 6 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:44:13 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What color is the countertop on the porch?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:46:41 - Input prompt:
00:46:41 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What color is the countertop on the porch?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 5 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 6 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:48:44 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where can I get drinking water in the kitchen?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:54:10 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Is the light above the sink turned on?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:56:04 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where is the wreath?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Question: Where can I warm up?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

01:00:06 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where can I warm up?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 5 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

01:02:18 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where can I warm up?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 5 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

01:05:01 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where can I warm up?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 5 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 6 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

01:06:42 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where is the microwave?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where is the microwave?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

01:10:46 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: where is the clock?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

01:12:55 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: where is the clock?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: where is the clock?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]picture
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]cabinet
snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]picture, shelf, tv
snapshot 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]cabinet
snapshot 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]picture
snapshot 5 [iVBORw0KGg...]picture
snapshot 6 [iVBORw0KGg...]cabinet, picture
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 5 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

01:17:55 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: where is the clock?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]cabinet
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]cabinet
snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]decoration, dining table
snapshot 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]shelf
snapshot 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]counter
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

01:20:11 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: where is the clock?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

01:24:22 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where is the fireplace?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i

01:25:50 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: what is between the fruit bowl and knife set?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

01:27:32 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: what is between the fruit bowl and knife set?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.

The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

01:29:17 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What is above the wooden table in the living room?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]plate, table
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]fan, potted plant
snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]picture, potted plant
snapshot 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]picture
snapshot 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]picture
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

01:31:40 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where can I get recipes for what to cook?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

01:36:27 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where can I get recipes for what to cook?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]table
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]refrigerator
snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]oven
snapshot 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]counter

Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

01:39:23 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: is the table in the living room completely clean?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

01:40:25 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: where is the paper roll?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]cabinet, sink, tissue box
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]shelf, stove
snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]shelf
snapshot 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]counter, trash bin
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

01:44:17 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where do I reach for laundry detergent?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]cabinet
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]laundry basket
snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]bottle, washing machine
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

01:46:05 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: is the television on or off?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.

01:47:57 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: is the television on or off?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]chair
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]tv
snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]couch
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

01:54:04 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where is the round mirror?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]cabinet, picture, tv
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]lamp, nightstand, picture
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

01:57:10 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: what color are the chairs?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]stool
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]bench
snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]bench, desk, stool
snapshot 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]counter
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

01:59:04 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What is behind the armchair in the living room?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

02:01:01 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Is the toilet seat open or closed?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

02:02:45 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Is the toilet seat open or closed?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]sink
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

02:05:08 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Is the toilet seat open or closed?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]mirror, sink
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]mirror, sink
snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]mirror
snapshot 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]bathtub
snapshot 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]mirror
snapshot 5 [iVBORw0KGg...]bathtub
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

02:07:09 - Input prompt:
02:07:09 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: what is kept on the tray in the kitchen counter?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]counter
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

02:09:12 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: I want to check my outfit for a dinner party, how can I do this?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]cabinet
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.
