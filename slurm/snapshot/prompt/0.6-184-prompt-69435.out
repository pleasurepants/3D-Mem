00:07:58 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: are the lamps in the second room on or off?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:10:45 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What is hanging from the ceiling in the bedroom?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:13:52 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: I need to blow my nose while taking a bath, what can I use?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i

The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:16:47 - Input prompt:
00:16:47 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where can I brush my teeth?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:16:51 - HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
00:16:51 - Response: [frontier 0]
Reason: [I see a door that may lead to another area, potentially a bathroom or kitchen where a toothbrush may be located. Exploring this could help find where to brush teeth.]
00:16:51 - Prediction: frontier, 0
00:16:51 - Next choice: Frontier at [116  81]

00:23:46 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Is the AC vent on the stairs open or closed?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Is the bathroom shower curtain open or closed?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:29:32 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where is the large green plant?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:35:41 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: How can I dry my towel?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:39:41 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: How many stories does this house have?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:41:42 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where should I put my jackets and shoes?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:46:42 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What color is the jacket on the clothes hangar?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:50:08 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What color is the jacket on the clothes hangar?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:52:45 - Input prompt:
00:52:45 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: is the door to the balcony open or closed
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:57:32 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Is the person who lives here an avid reader?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

01:00:35 - Input prompt:
01:00:35 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What room is the potted cactus in?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

01:11:19 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: are the electric lamps near the staircase on or off?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

01:12:01 - Input prompt:
01:12:01 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: are the electric lamps near the staircase on or off?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

01:17:10 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where can I get drinking water in the kitchen?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

01:19:40 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Is the bedroom door open?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

01:26:21 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where can I wash my hands on the second story of the house?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

01:28:18 - Input prompt:
01:28:18 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What is to the left of the black office chair?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

01:28:22 - HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
01:28:22 - Response: [frontier 1]
Reason: [I would like to explore this direction further because it appears to have a closer view of the area around the black office chair, which may provide information about what is to the left of it.]
01:28:22 - Prediction: frontier, 1
01:28:22 - Next choice: Frontier at [54 60]

01:33:33 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: do I need to install curtains to reduce the day light?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

01:34:56 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: do I need to install curtains to reduce the day light?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

01:43:06 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where is the baby high chair?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i

The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.

02:05:25 - Input prompt:
02:05:25 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What type of car is in the garage?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

02:05:27 - HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
02:05:27 - Response: [frontier 0]
Reason: [I see a better view of the garage and the car, which may help identify the type of car present.]
02:05:27 - Prediction: frontier, 0
02:05:27 - Next choice: Frontier at [ 25 164]

02:08:04 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What can I use to check my appearance?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Is the cloth hanger rack full?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

02:13:14 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Is the cloth hanger rack full?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

02:17:38 - Input prompt:
02:17:38 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Are all of the bulbs in the ceiling fan over the dining room table lit?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

02:17:43 - HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
02:17:43 - Response: [frontier 1]
Reason: [I would like to explore this direction because it may lead to a view that includes the dining room and the ceiling fan, allowing me to determine if all of the bulbs over the table are lit.]
02:17:43 - Prediction: frontier, 1
02:17:43 - Next choice: Frontier at [59 59]

02:22:49 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Does this house have a backyard?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

02:24:16 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Does this house have a backyard?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i

Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Does this house have a backyard?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

02:32:15 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Is the china cabinet full?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

02:35:37 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What can be seen through the window in the living room?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

02:41:12 - Input prompt:
02:41:12 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What cartoon animal is painted on the wall?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

02:41:16 - HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
02:41:16 - Response: [frontier 0]

02:44:59 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Is the coat closet in the living room open?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

02:46:37 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where is the fireplace?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

02:51:56 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: can I clean the floor with a mop?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

02:56:55 - Input prompt:
02:56:55 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What color is the car?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

02:56:57 - HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
02:56:57 - Response: [frontier 0]
Reason: [I see a car that appears to be in the garage, but I need to explore further to confirm its color.]
02:56:57 - Prediction: frontier, 0
02:56:57 - Next choice: Frontier at [ 25 164]

03:02:42 - Input prompt:
03:02:42 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: is there an area between the beds to place a glass of water
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

03:02:45 - HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
03:02:45 - Response: [frontier 0]
Reason: [I would like to explore this direction because it seems to lead to a larger area where the beds might be located, potentially allowing for a clearer view of the space between them to determine if there is room for a glass of water.]

03:05:14 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What is next to the posters on the wall in the staircase?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

03:10:09 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What is on top of the washing machine?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

03:12:17 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Which color is the dinning table?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

03:18:12 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where can I sit and eat if I don't want to use the dining table?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

03:20:08 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: what color are the numbers written on the wall clock?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

03:27:26 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: what color are the numbers written on the wall clock?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

03:31:25 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: what color are the numbers written on the wall clock?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 5 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

03:38:05 - Input prompt:
03:38:05 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What material are the blue pillow's pillowcases made out of?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

03:39:57 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: where is the standing lamp?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

03:39:59 - HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
03:39:59 - Response: [frontier 1]

03:43:55 - Input prompt:
03:43:55 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where can I use the bathroom?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

03:43:59 - HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
03:43:59 - Response: [frontier 0]
Reason: [I see a door in the room that may lead to other areas, potentially including a bathroom. Exploring this direction might provide more information.]

03:47:17 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Are the blinds closed?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

03:49:56 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Are the ceiling lights in the living room turned on?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i

The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

03:54:19 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What color is the bed comforter?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

04:06:21 - Input prompt:
04:06:21 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What is above the piano?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

04:06:25 - HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
04:06:25 - Response: [frontier 0]
Reason: [I see a dining table and possibly more of the room, which could provide a better view of the piano and what is above it.]
04:06:25 - Prediction: frontier, 0

04:14:10 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Is the toilet seat open or closed?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

04:15:41 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Is the toilet seat open or closed?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Is the toilet seat open or closed?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.
