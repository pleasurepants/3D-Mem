00:03:35 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What is hanging from the oven handle?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:05:11 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What is hanging from the oven handle?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:11:57 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where can I get drinking water in the kitchen?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:12:21 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where can I get drinking water in the kitchen?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where can I get drinking water in the kitchen?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:16:16 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where can I warm up?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:18:33 - Input prompt:
00:18:33 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where is the fireplace?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:18:36 - HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
00:18:36 - Response: [frontier 0]
Reason: [I see a doorway that may lead to another room where the fireplace could be located. Exploring this direction may provide more information about the fireplace's location.]
00:18:36 - Prediction: frontier, 0
00:18:36 - Next choice: Frontier at [82 35]

00:21:48 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: is the television on or off?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:24:06 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: is the television on or off?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:27:26 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: what color are the numbers written on the wall clock?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

00:29:09 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: what color are the numbers written on the wall clock?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:30:58 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: what color are the numbers written on the wall clock?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Frontier 5 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i

Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:32:41 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: what color are the numbers written on the wall clock?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]

Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:34:33 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: what color are the numbers written on the wall clock?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 5 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:36:19 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: what color are the numbers written on the wall clock?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.
