00:03:00 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Which bin should I put paper in?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i

The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:05:23 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: are the lamps in the second room on or off?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]blackboard, radiator, stool
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]curtain, storage organizer
snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]bed
snapshot 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]bed
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.

The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

00:09:48 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where is the plaid blanket?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]bed, pillow
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]bed, bench
snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]bed
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where is the plaid blanket?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]pillow
snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]bed, nightstand, pillow, wardrobe
snapshot 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]bed, bench
snapshot 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]nightstand, pillow
snapshot 5 [iVBORw0KGg...]pillow
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where is the plaid blanket?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]bed, nightstand, wardrobe
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]chair, end table, sofa chair
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:21:57 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where is the plaid blanket?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]bed, nightstand, wardrobe

Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:27:56 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where is the plaid blanket?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i

The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]bed, nightstand, wardrobe
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]end table
snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]dresser
snapshot 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]bed
snapshot 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]chair, end table, sofa chair
snapshot 5 [iVBORw0KGg...]end table
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:38:15 - Input prompt:
00:38:15 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where is the plaid blanket?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]end table
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]dresser
snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]bed
snapshot 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]cabinet
snapshot 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]cabinet
snapshot 5 [iVBORw0KGg...]cabinet, chair, end table, sofa chair
snapshot 6 [iVBORw0KGg...]bed, nightstand, wardrobe
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:40:49 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: I need to blow my nose while taking a bath, what can I use?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]cabinet, sink
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]bathtub
snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]bathtub
snapshot 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]shelf
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:45:19 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: I need to blow my nose while taking a bath, what can I use?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i

Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: I need to blow my nose while taking a bath, what can I use?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:58:05 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: I need to blow my nose while taking a bath, what can I use?

01:04:32 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What type of numbers are on the clock?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]clock
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]clock
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

01:06:50 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where can I brush my teeth?

01:08:49 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What is to the left of the mirror downstairs?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]picture
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]picture
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

01:11:02 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: what color is the chair?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

01:13:05 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: what is special about the wall in the living room?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]window
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1

Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where can I get a drink of water?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i

Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

01:24:21 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Is the AC vent on the stairs open or closed?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.

01:26:50 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Is the bathroom shower curtain open or closed?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i

The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

01:29:13 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Is there space on the dining table to work on my laptop?

01:33:19 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: what color is the door of the bedroom?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where is the large green plant?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.

Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.

01:43:52 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where is the large green plant?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where is the large green plant?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]chair
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]bicycle
snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]column
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

01:51:34 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where is the large green plant?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]poster
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]chair, dresser
snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]chair
snapshot 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]coat rack, mat
snapshot 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]chair
snapshot 5 [iVBORw0KGg...]mat
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore:

Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 5 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

01:56:58 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where is the large green plant?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]box, chair
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]mat
snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]chair

Frontier 5 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

02:01:41 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: what color is the flower in the bottom floor?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]potted plant
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Is there space for another pillow on the back of the bench with the coat hangers?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

02:10:34 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: How can I dry my towel?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]ladder, lamp
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]blinds
snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]power outlet
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

02:15:20 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What is the object to the left of the bed?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]clock, picture, radiator
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]poster, sink, toilet
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

02:22:13 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where should I put my jackets and shoes?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

02:26:17 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where should I put my jackets and shoes?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]box
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]shelf
snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]cabinet
snapshot 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]cabinet, shelf
snapshot 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]cabinet, coat rack
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

02:31:29 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Are the kitchen bar chairs tucked in?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]stool
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

02:32:46 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Are the kitchen bar chairs tucked in?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]stool
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]chair
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1

Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

02:35:09 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where is the three blade fan?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]bed, cabinet, chair, desk, tv
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]bed, tv
snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]bed, cabinet
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

02:37:04 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What color is the jacket on the clothes hangar?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: is the door to the balcony open or closed
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]bench
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

02:42:11 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where is the checkers board?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]armchair, stool
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]cabinet, dresser
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

02:44:28 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where is the checkers board?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]end table, sofa chair
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]cabinet, dresser
snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]bench, sofa chair
snapshot 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]sofa chair
snapshot 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]end table
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

02:49:18 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where is the checkers board?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

02:56:50 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Is the person who lives here an avid reader?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]dining table, lamp, picture
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]cabinet, lamp
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Is the backdoor open or closed?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]window
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]curtain
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

03:13:43 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What color is the trim around the mirror?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What color is the trim around the mirror?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
No Frontier is available
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

03:17:32 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What color are the pillows in the kitchen?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

03:19:50 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What color are the pillows in the kitchen?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

03:22:10 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Is this home on the first floor?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]power outlet
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]power outlet
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

03:25:07 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: where is the lamp that is switched on?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]bed
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]desk
snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]lamp, nightstand
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

03:27:51 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What material is the floor?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]bicycle, bucket
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]projector
snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]paper bag
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

03:29:46 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: what shape are the decorations above the bed?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]bed
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]bed
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

03:36:02 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where can I get drinking water in the kitchen?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

03:38:05 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Is the bedroom door open?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

03:40:25 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Is the bedroom door open?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

03:42:49 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Is the light above the sink turned on?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

03:46:20 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where can I wash my hands on the second story of the house?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

03:49:06 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What is on the center of the ceiling in the living room?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

03:54:47 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.

04:12:24 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: on which floor is the washing machine
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

04:16:08 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: on which floor is the washing machine
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

04:24:15 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where is the umbrella?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i

Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

04:34:26 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where is the umbrella?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

04:39:40 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where is the umbrella?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]cabinet
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]cabinet
snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]bag, box
snapshot 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]bench

Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 5 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

05:00:03 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where is the umbrella?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

05:06:00 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where is the umbrella?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

05:12:55 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: If I sit in the armchair in the living room, what animal can I touch with my right hand?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.

snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: If I sit in the armchair in the living room, what animal can I touch with my right hand?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]sofa chair
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]sofa chair
snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]sofa chair
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

05:20:36 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Is the sliding door open or closed?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]window
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

05:22:57 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where is the microwave?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]desk
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]cabinet
snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]cabinet
snapshot 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]cabinet
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

05:26:20 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where is the baby high chair?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.

05:37:15 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where is the baby high chair?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Frontier 5 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

05:53:28 - Input prompt:
05:53:28 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where is the full body mirror?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]mirror
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1

05:57:26 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: what color is the picture frame
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]end table, shelf
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]shelf
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

05:59:29 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What is the gold object on the nightstand?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]tissue box
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

06:02:21 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What color are the kitchen cabinets?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

06:04:19 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What color are the kitchen cabinets?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]chair
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]chair
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

06:12:51 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What's to the left of the toilet?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]cabinet
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]shelf
snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]potted plant, stool, trash bin

Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 5 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 6 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 7 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.

06:22:50 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What's to the left of the toilet?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]cabinet
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]potted plant

Frontier 6 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What's to the left of the toilet?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What color are the flowers on the black table downstairs?

If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: If you were to go down the stairs, then straight into the tv room, turn left in the door and go straight until you enter the last room, which room would it be?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]pillow
snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]curtain, pillow
snapshot 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]lamp
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

06:38:42 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: If you were to go down the stairs, then straight into the tv room, turn left in the door and go straight until you enter the last room, which room would it be?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]chair, pillow, sofa chair
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]bed, pillow
snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]cabinet
snapshot 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]end table, pillow
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: If you were to go down the stairs, then straight into the tv room, turn left in the door and go straight until you enter the last room, which room would it be?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

06:58:39 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: If you were to go down the stairs, then straight into the tv room, turn left in the door and go straight until you enter the last room, which room would it be?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: If you were to go down the stairs, then straight into the tv room, turn left in the door and go straight until you enter the last room, which room would it be?

Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

07:13:53 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: If you were to go down the stairs, then straight into the tv room, turn left in the door and go straight until you enter the last room, which room would it be?

07:22:50 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: If you were to go down the stairs, then straight into the tv room, turn left in the door and go straight until you enter the last room, which room would it be?

07:37:10 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: If you were to go down the stairs, then straight into the tv room, turn left in the door and go straight until you enter the last room, which room would it be?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]bed
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]sofa chair
snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]sofa chair
snapshot 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]desk, tv
snapshot 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]couch
snapshot 5 [iVBORw0KGg...]sofa chair
snapshot 6 [iVBORw0KGg...]couch
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 5 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 6 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 7 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 8 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

07:38:29 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: are the blinds in the workroom shut or not?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.

07:42:12 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: It's too bright in the living room, how can I make it darker?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]cabinet
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]cabinet
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: It's too bright in the living room, how can I make it darker?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.

07:51:34 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where is the china cabinet?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

07:53:39 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What can I use to check my appearance?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]picture
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]picture
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Is the cloth hanger rack full?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

07:58:00 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where is the blue cabinet?

08:00:46 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where is the blue cabinet?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]cabinet, potted plant
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]chair, shelf
snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]window
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

08:03:57 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where is the blue cabinet?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]cabinet
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

08:08:33 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where is the blue cabinet?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Where is the blue cabinet?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

08:16:16 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: what color is the tripod?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i

[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

08:19:25 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: what color is the tripod?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

08:21:16 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: what color is the tripod?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

08:23:13 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: what color is the tripod?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
No snapshot is available
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

08:25:06 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: What color is the staircase railing?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

08:28:58 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Are all of the bulbs in the ceiling fan over the dining room table lit?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]chair
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]chair

The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

08:32:28 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Are all of the bulbs in the ceiling fan over the dining room table lit?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]chair
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]chair
snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]chair
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 5 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Are all of the bulbs in the ceiling fan over the dining room table lit?

The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

08:46:50 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Who is the room with the books meant for?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore:

Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i

The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

08:48:13 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Does this house have a backyard?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]picture, poster
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]picture
snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]picture
snapshot 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]picture
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

08:52:52 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Does this house have a backyard?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.

09:06:17 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Does this house have a backyard?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

09:10:01 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Does this house have a backyard?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Does this house have a backyard?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.

The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

09:28:36 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: Is the china cabinet full?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

09:30:47 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore.
Definitions:
snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a snapshot.
Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore.
Question: what color are the dining room walls?
Select the Frontier/snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.
The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...]
The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes)
Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]picture
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]poster

snapshot 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]blinds
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.
snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]window
snapshot 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]couch, curtain, sofa chair
snapshot 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]chair
snapshot 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]curtain
snapshot 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]sofa chair
snapshot 5 [iVBORw0KGg...]sofa chair
The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore: 
Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...]
Please provide your answer in the following format: 'snapshot i
[Answer]' or 'Frontier i
[Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'snapshot 0
The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1
I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.
Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.
