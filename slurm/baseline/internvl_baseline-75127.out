Token indices sequence length is longer than the specified maximum sequence length for this model (66601 > 8192). Running this sequence through the model will result in indexing errors
WARNING 06-22 10:59:04 [profiling.py:232] The sequence length used for profiling (max_num_batched_tokens / max_num_seqs = 8192) is too short to hold the multi-modal embeddings in the worst case (66601 tokens in total, out of which {'image': 66560} are reserved for multi-modal embeddings). This may cause certain multi-modal inputs to fail during inference, even when the input text is short. To avoid this, you should increase `max_model_len`, reduce `max_num_seqs`, and/or reduce `mm_counts`.

INFO 06-22 11:00:32 [model_runner.py:1513] Capturing cudagraphs for decoding. This may lead to unexpected consequences if the model is not static. To run the model in eager mode, set 'enforce_eager=True' or use '--enforce-eager' in the CLI. If out-of-memory error occurs during cudagraph capture, consider decreasing `gpu_memory_utilization` or switching to eager mode. You can also reduce the `max_num_seqs` as needed to decrease memory usage.

00:01:04 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: What is hanging from the oven handle?

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; You must only choose from the provided Snapshot or Frontier indices.

00:01:43 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: What is hanging from the oven handle? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model.

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others.

To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: What is hanging from the oven handle?

To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: What is hanging from the oven handle? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model.

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.

Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.

To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: What material are the stools in the kitchen made out of?

To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: What material are the stools in the kitchen made out of? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model.

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; You must only choose from the provided Snapshot or Frontier indices. Do not make up an index that is not listed above.(2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: where can I keep a new knife I got?

00:22:36 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: What color are the pillows in the kitchen? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model.

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; You must only choose from the provided Snapshot or Frontier indices.

00:23:40 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: What color is the countertop on the porch?

00:29:53 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: Where can I get drinking water in the kitchen?

Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: Where can I get drinking water in the kitchen? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.

00:35:08 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: Is the light above the sink turned on? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model.

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others.

00:36:24 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: Is the light above the sink turned on? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; You must only choose from the provided Snapshot or Frontier indices. Do not make up an index that is not listed above.(2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.

To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: Where is the microwave? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model.

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; You must only choose from the provided Snapshot or Frontier indices.

To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: Where is the microwave? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model.

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; You must only choose from the provided Snapshot or Frontier indices. Do not make up an index that is not listed above.(2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: is the table in the living room completely clean?

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; You must only choose from the provided Snapshot or Frontier indices.

To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: where is the paper roll? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; You must only choose from the provided Snapshot or Frontier indices. Do not make up an index that is not listed above.(2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:57:51 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: is the television on or off? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model.

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others.

00:58:11 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: is the television on or off? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model.

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; You must only choose from the provided Snapshot or Frontier indices.

Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: is the television on or off? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model.

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others.

To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: what color are the numbers written on the wall clock? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; You must only choose from the provided Snapshot or Frontier indices. Do not make up an index that is not listed above.(2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

01:01:40 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: what color are the numbers written on the wall clock? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; You must only choose from the provided Snapshot or Frontier indices.

Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: what color are the numbers written on the wall clock?

01:03:38 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: what color are the numbers written on the wall clock? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; You must only choose from the provided Snapshot or Frontier indices. Do not make up an index that is not listed above.(2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: what color are the numbers written on the wall clock? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model.

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others.

Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: what color are the numbers written on the wall clock?

01:11:12 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: What is behind the armchair in the living room? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions. No Snapshot is available The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore:  Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...] Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i [Answer]' or 'Frontier i [Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; You must only choose from the provided Snapshot or Frontier indices. Do not make up an index that is not listed above.(2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: what is kept on the tray in the kitchen counter?

01:16:56 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: What is to the left of the frontdoor? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model.

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; You must only choose from the provided Snapshot or Frontier indices. Do not make up an index that is not listed above.(2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

01:20:22 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: I want to check my outfit for a dinner party, how can I do this? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; You must only choose from the provided Snapshot or Frontier indices. Do not make up an index that is not listed above.(2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question. You must only choose from the provided Snapshot or Frontier indices. Do not make up an index that is not listed above.
