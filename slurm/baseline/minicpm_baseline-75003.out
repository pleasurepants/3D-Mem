INFO 06-21 17:18:26 [model_runner.py:1513] Capturing cudagraphs for decoding. This may lead to unexpected consequences if the model is not static. To run the model in eager mode, set 'enforce_eager=True' or use '--enforce-eager' in the CLI. If out-of-memory error occurs during cudagraph capture, consider decreasing `gpu_memory_utilization` or switching to eager mode. You can also reduce the `max_num_seqs` as needed to decrease memory usage.

Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question.

To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: What type of numbers are on the clock?

The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model.

If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.

00:02:36 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: I want to host a dinner party on a summer evening, where should I set the table? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model.

If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'.

UserWarning: *c* argument looks like a single numeric RGB or RGBA sequence, which should be avoided as value-mapping will have precedence in case its length matches with *x* & *y*.  Please use the *color* keyword-argument or provide a 2D array with a single row if you intend to specify the same RGB or RGBA value for all points.
