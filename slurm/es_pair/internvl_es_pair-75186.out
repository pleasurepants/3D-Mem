00:00:39 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: What is hanging from the oven handle? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions. No Snapshot is available The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore:  Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...] Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i [Answer]' or 'Frontier i [Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

Token indices sequence length is longer than the specified maximum sequence length for this model (66601 > 8192). Running this sequence through the model will result in indexing errors
WARNING 06-22 22:04:03 [profiling.py:232] The sequence length used for profiling (max_num_batched_tokens / max_num_seqs = 8192) is too short to hold the multi-modal embeddings in the worst case (66601 tokens in total, out of which {'image': 66560} are reserved for multi-modal embeddings). This may cause certain multi-modal inputs to fail during inference, even when the input text is short. To avoid this, you should increase `max_model_len`, reduce `max_num_seqs`, and/or reduce `mm_counts`.

00:01:28 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: What is hanging from the oven handle? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions. No Snapshot is available The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore:  Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 5 [iVBORw0KGg...] Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i [Answer]' or 'Frontier i [Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:02:29 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: What is hanging from the oven handle? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions. No Snapshot is available The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore:  Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 4 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 5 [iVBORw0KGg...] Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i [Answer]' or 'Frontier i [Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:08:35 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: What material are the stools in the kitchen made out of? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions. Snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]stool The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore:  Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...] Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i [Answer]' or 'Frontier i [Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: I want to host a dinner party on a summer evening, where should I set the table?

00:12:48 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: I want to host a dinner party on a summer evening, where should I set the table? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions. No Snapshot is available The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore:  Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...] Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i [Answer]' or 'Frontier i [Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: where can I keep a new knife I got? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model.

00:15:15 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: What color are the pillows in the kitchen? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions. Snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]pillow The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore:  Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...] Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i [Answer]' or 'Frontier i [Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others.

00:17:56 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: Where can I get drinking water in the kitchen? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions. No Snapshot is available The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore:  Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...] Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i [Answer]' or 'Frontier i [Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:18:37 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: Where can I get drinking water in the kitchen? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:18:54 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: Where can I get drinking water in the kitchen? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model.

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:19:30 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: Where can I get drinking water in the kitchen? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model.

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: Where can I get drinking water in the kitchen? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question.

Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: Where can I get drinking water in the kitchen?

00:21:05 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: Is the light above the sink turned on? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model.

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:21:17 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: Is the light above the sink turned on? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions. No Snapshot is available The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore:  Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...] Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i [Answer]' or 'Frontier i [Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:21:43 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: Is the light above the sink turned on? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions. No Snapshot is available The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore:  Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...] Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i [Answer]' or 'Frontier i [Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:24:38 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: Where is the wreath? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions. Snapshot 0 [iVBORw0KGg...]curtain The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore:  Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...] Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i [Answer]' or 'Frontier i [Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:24:50 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: Where is the wreath? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model.

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:26:20 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: Where is the microwave? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model.

To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: Where is the microwave?

Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. <|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\n<image>\n<image>\n<image>\n<image>\n<image>\n<image>\nQuestion: Where is the microwave? \nSelect the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. \nThe following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: \n \nThe followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model.

If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question. <|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.7, top_p=0.95, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=4096, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

00:28:37 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: Where is the microwave? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions. No Snapshot is available The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore:  Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...] Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i [Answer]' or 'Frontier i [Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction.

00:29:49 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: Where is the microwave? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: Where is the microwave?

To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot.

00:32:40 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: What can be seen through the window in the living room? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions. No Snapshot is available The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore:  Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...] Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i [Answer]' or 'Frontier i [Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:32:55 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: What can be seen through the window in the living room? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model.

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others.

00:34:26 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: Where is the fireplace? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions. No Snapshot is available The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore:  Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...] Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i [Answer]' or 'Frontier i [Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: what is between the fruit bowl and knife set?

To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: what is between the fruit bowl and knife set? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model.

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:37:17 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: Where can I get recipes for what to cook? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model.

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:37:33 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: Where can I get recipes for what to cook? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:38:23 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: is the table in the living room completely clean? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:38:52 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: is the table in the living room completely clean? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions. No Snapshot is available The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore:  Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...] Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i [Answer]' or 'Frontier i [Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:40:06 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: is the table in the living room completely clean? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:40:22 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: is the table in the living room completely clean? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions. No Snapshot is available The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore:  Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...] Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i [Answer]' or 'Frontier i [Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: is the table in the living room completely clean? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model.

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others.

To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: is the table in the living room completely clean? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model.

00:42:43 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: is the table in the living room completely clean? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions. No Snapshot is available The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore:  Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...] Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i [Answer]' or 'Frontier i [Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: is the table in the living room completely clean?

To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: is the table in the living room completely clean?

00:45:35 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: is the table in the living room completely clean? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions. No Snapshot is available The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore:  Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...] Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i [Answer]' or 'Frontier i [Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:46:16 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: is the table in the living room completely clean? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:46:34 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: is the table in the living room completely clean? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:47:09 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: is the table in the living room completely clean?

The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model.

00:47:17 - Next choice: Frontier at [ 6 50]
UserWarning: *c* argument looks like a single numeric RGB or RGBA sequence, which should be avoided as value-mapping will have precedence in case its length matches with *x* & *y*.  Please use the *color* keyword-argument or provide a 2D array with a single row if you intend to specify the same RGB or RGBA value for all points.

To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: is the table in the living room completely clean? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions. No Snapshot is available The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore:  Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...] Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i [Answer]' or 'Frontier i [Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:49:54 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: is the table in the living room completely clean? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:51:36 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: is the table in the living room completely clean? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model.

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:53:58 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: where is the paper roll? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions. No Snapshot is available The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore:  Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...] Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i [Answer]' or 'Frontier i [Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:55:56 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: where is the paper roll? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model.

If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:56:28 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: where is the paper roll? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions. No Snapshot is available The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore:  Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...] Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i [Answer]' or 'Frontier i [Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:57:03 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: where is the paper roll? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model.

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: where is the paper roll? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model.

00:58:51 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: where is the paper roll? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model.

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:59:15 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: where is the paper roll? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:59:37 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: where is the paper roll? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

00:59:57 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: where is the paper roll? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model.

01:00:59 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: is the television on or off? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions. No Snapshot is available The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore:  Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...] Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i [Answer]' or 'Frontier i [Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

01:01:34 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: is the television on or off? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions. No Snapshot is available The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore:  Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...] Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i [Answer]' or 'Frontier i [Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: what color are the numbers written on the wall clock? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions. No Snapshot is available The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore:  Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 3 [iVBORw0KGg...] Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i [Answer]' or 'Frontier i [Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

01:03:45 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: what color are the numbers written on the wall clock? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions.

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others.

01:05:09 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: what color are the numbers written on the wall clock? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model.

01:05:20 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: what color are the numbers written on the wall clock? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model.

For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

01:05:57 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: what color are the numbers written on the wall clock? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions. No Snapshot is available The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore:  Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...] Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i [Answer]' or 'Frontier i [Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.

01:06:31 - Task: You are an agent in an indoor scene tasked with answering questions by observing the surroundings and exploring the environment. To answer the question, you are required to choose either a Snapshot as the answer or a Frontier to further explore. Definitions: Snapshot: A focused observation of several objects. Choosing a Snapshot means that this snapshot image contains enough information for you to answer the question. If you choose a Snapshot, you need to directly give an answer to the question. If you don't have enough information to give an answer, then don't choose a Snapshot. Frontier: An observation of an unexplored region that could potentially lead to new information for answering the question. Selecting a frontier means that you will further explore that direction. If you choose a Frontier, you need to explain why you would like to choose that direction to explore. Question: what color are the numbers written on the wall clock? Select the Frontier/Snapshot that would help find the answer of the question. The following is the egocentric view of the agent in forward direction: [iVBORw0KGg...] The followings are all the snapshots that you can choose (followed with contained object classes) Please note that the contained classes may not be accurate (wrong classes/missing classes) due to the limitation of the object detection model. So you still need to utilize the images to make decisions. No Snapshot is available The followings are all the Frontiers that you can explore:  Frontier 0 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 1 [iVBORw0KGg...] Frontier 2 [iVBORw0KGg...] Please provide your answer in the following format: 'Snapshot i [Answer]' or 'Frontier i [Reason]', where i is the index of the snapshot or frontier you choose. For example, if you choose the first snapshot, you can return 'Snapshot 0 The fruit bowl is on the kitchen counter.'. If you choose the second frontier, you can return 'Frontier 1 I see a door that may lead to the living room.'. Note that if you choose a snapshot to answer the question, (1) you should give a direct answer that can be understood by others. Don't mention words like 'snapshot', 'on the left of the image', etc; (2) you can also utilize other snapshots, frontiers and egocentric views to gather more information, but you should always choose one most relevant snapshot to answer the question.
